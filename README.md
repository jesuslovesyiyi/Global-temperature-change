# Understanding Climate Change
Check out a series of small and fun Python notebook exercises that allows you to get your hands dirty with climate data!

## Basic info for running the code in a notebook environment:

To run a cell, press Shift + Enter  
To restart the analysis (i.e. clean the variables and RAM, but keep the downloaded data), restart the runtime from the top menu  
To completely start over (i.e. clean RAM and temporary storage that may contain downloaded data or any saved figure), go to Runtime>Manage sessions->TERMINATE.
